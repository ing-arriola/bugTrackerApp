# Bug Manager App

# Developed by Jaime Arriola

- Situation: Every company works with teams so, it's really important for an employee to be aware of which are his or her tasks and the state of those tasks.

- Action: I followed a tutorial but I made changes into the original application developed by the instructor in order to create a Bug Tracker App, but if you think about it this application can be applied into other departaments not just applications department.

- Result: I came up with this MERN application with allows you to create an account, login, logout, create tasks, delete them and also update your tasks.
